-- Purpose : build the analytics layer
--   analytics.dim_airline        one clean display name per ICAO code
--   analytics.movements          arrivals + departures in one table with
--                                delay, taxi and quality flags
--   analytics.monthly_coverage   which months have complete data
--
-- Metric definitions (copy into the README):
--   delay_min        actual block time minus scheduled block time, minutes.
--                    Negative = early. Departures use off-block, arrivals in-block.
--   is_delayed_15    delay_min > 15 (industry OTP convention).
--   delay_outlier    delay_min < -60 or > 600. Almost always a data-entry
--                    or date-roll artefact; excluded from averages.
--   taxi_min         arrivals: in-block minus landing (taxi-in)
--                    departures: take-off minus off-block (taxi-out)
--   taxi_outlier     taxi_min < 0 or > 90.
--   is_operated      the flight actually moved (has an actual_time and a
--                    completed status). Cancelled flights have no delay.
--   coverage_complete every day of the month is present AND the average
--                    movements per day is at least MIN_PER_DAY for that
--                    direction. Volume trends must filter on this flag;
--                    per-flight rates (delay %, cancel %) do not need to.
--
-- Cleaning decision D9: aodbuniquefield is only unique WITHIN a direction.
--   83 ids appear in both files attached to unrelated flights, so the
--   movements table uses (direction, flight_id) as its key and exposes
--   movement_key = direction || '-' || flight_id for joins from Python
--   and the dashboards.

-- 1. Airline dimension: the most frequent raw name per ICAO code becomes
--    the display name. Fixes 'Flydubai' / 'Fly dubai' and similar splits

-- 3. Monthly coverage: flag months where the export is incomplete.
--    Two failure modes exist in this export:
--      a) missing days   (Dec 2025 has 15 of 31 days)
--      b) thin days      (Mar to Aug 2026 have every day but only
--                         ~260 to 500 movements/day vs ~620 to 660 normally)
--    So the flag needs both tests. MIN_PER_DAY = 550 separates the two
--    groups cleanly; adjust it if you refresh the export.
